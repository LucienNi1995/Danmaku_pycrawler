# Danmaku_pycrawler
Modified from https://github.com/wbt5/real-url.

Instead of just scrapping the real-time danmaku of one livestreaming in the original github project, this project can scrap real-time danmaku, gifts received and all relevant information in the room of the streamers in a multithreading manner. It also provided a multithreading livestraming real-time recording method but the stability depends on the source addresses provided by each platform.

Currently works for Huya.com only.
